GenLoaders.py will generate a loader skin for you. Open config.py with a text editor and follow the instructions. Then run GenLoaders.py and it will generate three skins for you.

One skin will be a loader. When this skin is loaded, the theme will be loaded and setup.  
One skin will be an unloader. When this skin is loaded, the theme will be completely unloaded.  
One skill will be a refresher. When this skin is loaded, all of the skins in the theme will be refreshed.


Copy these three skin folders into a separate rainmeter skin, and then activate them accordingly. It's actually rather simple.


The skin has THREE example users, along with three example loader, refresher and unloader skins. In real world use, you would probably want to separate the loader skins into your skin's folder.  
But for example's sake, they're put in this skin folder.
