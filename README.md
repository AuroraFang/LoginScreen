GenLoaders.py will generate a loader skin for you. Open config.py with a text editor and follow the instructions. Then run GenLoaders.py and it will generate three skins for you.

One skin will be a loader. When this skin is loaded, the theme will be loaded and setup.  
One skin will be an unloader. When this skin is loaded, the theme will be completely unloaded.  
One skill will be a refresher. When this skin is loaded, all of the skins in the theme will be refreshed.
